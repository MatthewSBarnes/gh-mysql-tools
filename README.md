# gh-mysql-tools

General purpose MySQL tools by GitHub Engineering

### General notes

This repository publishes tools created and used by GitHub's Database Infrastructure team. These will be small tools/scripts/configs that we use internally at GitHub.

To be able to publish these tools, we strip out GitHub-specific code (e.g. integration with our chatops, monitoring etc.). We publish the tools "as is", under the MIT license, and without support. At this time we do not expect to maintain the tools on this repository, though we may periodically update them based on internal development.
